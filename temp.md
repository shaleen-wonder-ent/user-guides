# Azure VNet-to-VNet Connectivity: NAT, Peering, and Private Link

## 1. Background

- **Original Plan:** HCL to connect to customer’s on-premises via ExpressRoute.
- **Updated Plan:** HCL will connect to the customer’s Azure VNet. The customer will manage on-premises connectivity from their VNet.
- **Key Requirement:** HCL and customer want to avoid sharing actual address spaces (due to overlap/privacy). Both sides are considering NAT to “hide” private IPs and use a mutually agreed address range.

---

## 2. VNet Peering & NAT

### **Is NAT possible with VNet Peering (without VPN)?**

- **VNet Peering** alone does **not** provide NAT functionality.
    - Peering connects VNets at the Azure backbone level, but does **not translate IP addresses**.
    - Peered VNets must have **non-overlapping address spaces**.
- **Azure NAT Gateway** is for outbound internet traffic only, **not** for VNet-to-VNet peering.
- **To achieve NAT between VNets:**
    - Deploy an **Azure Firewall** or **Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)** in your VNet.
    - Route all VNet-to-VNet traffic through this device for SNAT/DNAT.
    - Both sides can deploy their own NAT devices for mutual address hiding.

**Summary:**  
> VNet Peering alone cannot provide NAT or address hiding.  
> NAT for VNet-to-VNet traffic requires Azure Firewall or NVA, with routing configured accordingly.

---

## 3. Private Endpoint / Private Link & Traffic Inspection

### **Scenario**

- HCL may expose services (e.g., Load Balancer) via **Private Endpoint/Private Link** for the customer.
- The customer may expose their services to HCL via Private Link.
- Both sides want to know if traffic can be inspected.

### **Key Points**

- **Private Endpoint/Private Link** allows access to a specific resource over a private IP in the consumer’s VNet.
- **Traffic Inspection:**
    - The resource owner (provider) can inspect incoming traffic **if routed through a firewall or NVA** using User Defined Routes (UDR).
    - Outbound traffic from the provider to the consumer can be inspected similarly on the provider’s side.
- **Bidirectional Communication:**  
    - Private Link is **resource-specific** (not general VNet-to-VNet).
    - For two-way communication, each side must expose resources via Private Link and configure inspection as needed.

## 4. Summary Table

| Requirement                | VNet Peering | Private Link/Endpoint | NAT Support                | Traffic Inspection                |
|----------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hide address space         | ❌           | ✅ (resource-level)   | Needs NVA/Azure Firewall   | With NVA/Azure Firewall           |
| NAT possible?              | ❌           | N/A                  | Needs NVA/Azure Firewall   | N/A                               |
| Traffic inspection         | ❌           | ✅ (with UDR+Firewall)| ✅ (if routed via Firewall) | ✅ (if routed via Firewall/NVA)    |

---

## 5. Recommendations
- For **full VNet-to-VNet NAT**, deploy an **Azure Firewall** or **NVA** in each VNet and route all inter-VNet traffic through it.
- For **resource-specific access**, use **Private Link/Endpoint** and integrate with a firewall/NVA for inspection.
- Agree on a mutually available address space for NAT.
- Document routing and inspection requirements for both sides.

# Customer Connectivity Discussion Summary  
Date: 2025-10-24  
Presenter: HCL (on behalf of customer engagement)  

## 1. Context & Evolution of Requirement
Originally the customer asked HCL to connect from their on‑premises environment into HCL’s Azure environment using **Azure ExpressRoute** (they accidentally referred to “Direct Connect” which is AWS terminology).  
Later they changed the plan:  
- They will themselves manage on‑premises to Azure connectivity.  
- New requirement: Establish **VNet-to-VNet connectivity** directly between their Azure VNet and HCL’s Azure VNet.  
- They want to avoid exposure of internal address spaces (or may have overlapping IP ranges).  
- They seek options for NAT, address obfuscation, or service-level exposure instead of full network trust.  
- Bidirectional traffic initiation is required (both sides may originate connections).  

## 2. Key Questions Raised
1. Can we “just do NAT” with VNet peering to hide or translate address space?  
2. Is NAT possible inside a VNet without involving VPN gateways and still work with peering?  
3. If we avoid peering and instead use **Private Link / Private Endpoint**, can both sides expose services?  
4. Can traffic be inspected (security / compliance) when using Private Link?  
5. What to do if address spaces overlap or must remain confidential?

## 3. Core Azure Networking Facts
| Feature | Native NAT Between VNets | Supports Overlapping CIDRs | Hides Real Address Space | Bidirectional Full Network Traffic | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| VNet Peering | No | No (cannot overlap) | No | Yes | Fast, low latency, private Microsoft backbone. |
| VNet-to-VNet VPN (IPsec) + Gateway NAT | Yes (Gateway NAT) | Yes (with translation) | Yes (presented / translated ranges only) | Yes | Throughput bound by gateway SKU. |
| Azure NAT Gateway | Only outbound to Internet | N/A | No (not for inter-VNet) | N/A | Not suitable for this use case. |
| Azure Firewall / NVA (SNAT/DNAT) | Yes (custom) | Yes (you can translate) | Yes (if all cross-VNet forced through appliance) | Yes | Requires UDRs and still needs non-overlapping real CIDRs for peering. |
| Private Link / Private Endpoint | Service-scoped only | Not required | Yes (consumer IP abstracted) | One-direction per exposed service | Not general network adjacency. |
| Private Link Service (You publish) | Service-scoped | Not required | Yes | Consumer initiates | Each side must publish separately for mutual access. |

## 4. Answers to Specific Questions
- **NAT with Peering?** Not natively. VNet peering does not provide translation; it requires non-overlapping real CIDRs and exposes them via routing tables.  
- **Perform NAT “inside” a VNet without VPN to support peering?** Only by inserting an Azure Firewall or third-party Network Virtual Appliance and forcing all cross-VNet traffic through it using User Defined Routes (UDRs). This still requires non-overlapping real CIDRs for peering establishment.  
- **Private Link for bidirectional generic connectivity?** No. Private Link is per-service (consumer → provider). For true two-way service exposure each side must independently publish services via Private Link Service and the other side creates private endpoints.  
- **Traffic Inspection with Private Link?** Yes.  
  - Provider side: Use a Standard Load Balancer + Gateway Load Balancer chaining an NVA/Azure Firewall for inline inspection before the backend.  
  - Consumer side: Use UDRs to steer outbound traffic (to the private endpoint’s alias) through an inspection NVA/Azure Firewall.  
- **Overlapping or confidential address spaces?**  
  - Use VNet-to-VNet **VPN with Gateway NAT** (each side presents a “translated/presentation” CIDR).  
  - Or avoid full network sharing: expose only required services via Private Link each way.

## 5. Architectural Patterns Considered
### Pattern A: Simple VNet Peering
- Requires unique, non-overlapping CIDRs.
- Fastest, simplest.
- No obfuscation of addresses.

### Pattern B: Peering + Azure Firewall / NVA for SNAT/DNAT
- Still needs unique CIDRs for peering.
- Firewalls SNAT outbound traffic to a presentation range the other party allowlists.
- Adds cost/complexity; enables logging & policy enforcement.

### Pattern C: VNet-to-VNet VPN with Gateway NAT
- Solves overlapping CIDRs.
- Each side presents agreed translated ranges (e.g. HCL: 10.5.0.0/16 → 192.168.10.0/24; Customer: 10.5.0.0/16 → 192.168.20.0/24).
- Bidirectional, preserves real internal addressing confidentiality.
- Throughput limited by gateway SKU; slightly more latency than peering.

### Pattern D: Service-Level Exposure via Private Link (Both Directions)
- No network-wide trust—only selected services.
- Minimal IP disclosure.
- Not suitable for broad lateral connectivity.
- Each side publishes needed services; other side consumes via private endpoints.

### Pattern E: Hybrid
- Create a “presentation” VNet (clean CIDR) for peering + Private Link for sensitive/high-risk services.
- Optional Firewall/NVA for inspection and selective NAT.

## 6. Decision Matrix
| Requirement | Recommended Pattern |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Full network, non-overlapping CIDRs, performance critical | Pattern A |
| Need address obfuscation (but CIDRs unique) | Pattern B |
| Overlapping CIDRs or strict confidentiality | Pattern C |
| Only a few services exposed, minimize trust | Pattern D |
| Mixed needs (some broad, some restricted) | Pattern E |

## 7. NAT Mechanisms Summary
| Mechanism | Use Case | Limitation |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Gateway NAT (VPN Gateway) | Overlapping or mask real CIDR in site/VNet-to-VNet tunnels | Requires VPN gateway (not peering) |
| Azure Firewall SNAT | Hide source addresses / create presentation range | Cannot create peering if CIDRs overlap |
| NVA SNAT/DNAT | Advanced custom translation, logging | Operational overhead |
| Azure NAT Gateway | Outbound to Internet only | Not usable for inter-VNet or peering NAT |

## 8. Security & Inspection Options
- Inline L3/L4: Azure Firewall or NVA in hub, enforce via UDR.
- Service Ingress: Gateway Load Balancer chaining to NVA behind Standard Load Balancer (Private Link Service scenario).
- Egress Control: UDRs from workload subnets to Firewall for destination prefixes / FQDN filtering.
- Threat Detection: Defender for Cloud, Azure Firewall Threat Intel, IDS/IPS-capable NVAs.
- Logging: NSG Flow Logs (Traffic Analytics), Firewall logs (sent to Log Analytics), NVA logs.

## 9. Recommended Next Steps (Action Items)
1. Confirm whether current HCL and customer VNet CIDRs overlap.  
2. Decide on scope: full network access vs limited services.  
3. If overlap or confidentiality required: move toward Pattern C (VNet-to-VNet VPN + Gateway NAT).  
4. If no overlap and broader access acceptable: Pattern B (Peering + Firewall SNAT) if address masking desired; else Pattern A.  
5. Identify “presentation” CIDR blocks (non-routable internally) for translation (e.g. 172.16.x.x or 192.168.x.x ranges mutually agreed).  
6. Define allowed protocols/ports and logging requirements.  
7. Evaluate throughput needs (estimate peak Mbps/Gbps) to size VPN Gateway or Firewall SKU.  
8. Draft governance document: incident response, change management, key rotation (for VPN), service onboarding process (for Private Link).  
9. Implement pilot: Start with one test subnet/service, validate routing, NAT correctness, and logging.  
10. Roll out production with formal acceptance test (connectivity matrix, latency, failover test).

## 10. Clarifying Questions to Customer (For Finalization)
- Do any current CIDR blocks overlap with HCL’s internal address ranges?  
- Required bandwidth (peak and sustained)?  
- Number and type of services that must be reachable (ports, protocols)?  
- Compliance or audit requirements for traffic inspection/log retention?  
- Is future expansion to multi-cloud (e.g., AWS) anticipated (affects translation strategy)?  
- Are they comfortable managing shared “presentation” ranges, or prefer pure service exposure only?

## 11. Summary for Presentation
The initial ExpressRoute requirement shifted to pure Azure VNet-to-VNet connectivity. Native VNet peering cannot hide or translate address space and disallows overlapping IP ranges. If address confidentiality or overlaps exist, a VNet-to-VNet VPN with Gateway NAT is the clean solution, providing bidirectional translated connectivity. If only specific services need sharing, Private Link each way minimizes exposure while enabling inspection via Gateway Load Balancer + NVAs. A decision hinges on overlap status, breadth of required access, and performance/security priorities.

## 12. Recommended Baseline Architecture (If Overlap or Confidentiality Confirmed)
1. Deploy VPN Gateways (active-active) in both VNets.  
2. Configure Gateway NAT rules (internal → presentation CIDR).  
3. Establish IPsec VNet-to-VNet connection.  
4. Attach Azure Firewall (optional) for advanced inspection/logging.  
5. Document translation mapping and route tables; test end-to-end flows.

## 13. Alternative (If No Overlap, Need Speed)
1. Create cleaned “presentation” VNet with non-overlapping CIDR.  
2. Peer presentation VNet to customer’s VNet.  
3. Insert Azure Firewall for SNAT to presentation range.  
4. UDRs force workload traffic through Firewall for masking & logging.

# 🌐 Azure Connectivity Design Discussion Summary  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Participants:** HCL & Customer Cloud Network Teams  
**Topic:** Azure-to-Azure Connectivity and Design Considerations  

---

## 1️⃣ Background

Earlier, the customer proposed connecting **HCL’s Azure environment** to their **on-prem network via ExpressRoute**.  
Now, the customer has revised the requirement:  

> The connectivity will be **from HCL’s Azure VNet to the customer’s Azure VNet**.  
> The customer will manage their internal connectivity to on-prem from their side.

---

## 2️⃣ New Requirement Overview

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Connectivity Type** | Azure-to-Azure (VNet-to-VNet) |
| **Address Space Overlap** | Possible – requires NAT consideration |
| **Traffic Flow** | Bidirectional (both sides initiate communication) |
| **Connectivity Method** | Preferably VNet Peering (or Private Link for specific services) |
| **Security** | Customer wants to retain ability to inspect and control inbound/outbound traffic |

---

## 3️⃣ Connectivity Options

### 🟢 Option 1 – **VNet Peering (Direct, No NAT)**

**Overview:**  
- Azure-native method to connect two VNets privately using Microsoft’s backbone network.  
- Provides **low-latency, high-bandwidth** connectivity.

**How it works:**  
- Create a **VNet peering** between HCL and Customer VNets.  
- Enable “Allow traffic from remote VNet” on both sides.  
- Traffic flows privately through Azure’s backbone.

**Limitations:**  
- ❌ No built-in NAT capability.  
- ❌ Requires **non-overlapping IP ranges** between both VNets.  
- NAT Gateway **cannot** be used for VNet-to-VNet NAT (only outbound to Internet).  

**When to use:**  
- When address spaces are unique and full bidirectional trust is acceptable.

---

### 🟡 Option 2 – **VNet Peering + NAT via Azure Firewall / NVA**

**Architecture:**
```
[HCL VNet]
    │
    │  (Peering)
    ▼
[Intermediate Hub VNet]
   │  (Azure Firewall / NVA for NAT & Inspection)
   │
   ▼
[Customer VNet]
```

**How it works:**  
- VNet peering establishes basic connectivity.  
- An **Azure Firewall** or **third-party NVA** (Fortinet, Palo Alto, Check Point, etc.) performs NAT translation.  
- Both sides can define **mutually agreed NAT ranges** to avoid exposing internal IPs.  
- Use **User Defined Routes (UDRs)** to direct traffic through the NAT device.

**Advantages:**  
✅ Supports NAT (hides real address spaces)  
✅ Enables **traffic inspection and control**  
✅ Works fully over Azure backbone (no VPN needed)  
✅ Allows **bidirectional communication**

**Considerations:**  
⚠️ Adds firewall/NVA cost and slight latency  
⚠️ Requires NAT rule and route management  
⚠️ Must define NAT ranges carefully to avoid conflicts  

**When to use:**  
- When **IP overlap** exists or private subnets should be masked.  
- When **inspection or security policies** are required.  

---

### 🔵 Option 3 – **Private Link / Private Endpoint**

**Overview:**  
Used when only **specific services** (e.g., load balancers, APIs, or databases) need to be shared privately between HCL and the customer.

**How it works:**  
- Provider exposes a service using a **Private Link Service (PLS)**.  
- Consumer creates a **Private Endpoint** to access that service securely.  
- Communication occurs **privately** via Azure backbone — no exposure to the Internet or full VNet.

**Key Points:**  
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Scope** | Service-level, not full VNet |
| **Traffic Inspection** | Possible if the Private Link is fronted by a Firewall or NVA |
| **Directionality** | Typically consumer → provider (one-way) |
| **Security** | IPs are not exposed; traffic is fully private |

**When to use:**  
- When only certain applications or APIs need private access.  
- When **tight segmentation** and **zero-trust** access are desired.

---

## 4️⃣ NAT with VNet Peering – Feasibility

Azure **does not support NAT natively** with VNet peering.  
To achieve NAT functionality:  
- Use **Azure Firewall** or **Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)**.  
- Configure NAT rules (Source/Destination Translation).  
- Route traffic through this firewall/NVA using **UDRs**.

So, **NAT can exist in the same VNet**, but **must be explicitly handled via Firewall or NVA** — it is **not automatically associated** with peering.

---

## 5️⃣ Traffic Inspection Scenarios

| Scenario | Inspection Option |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Peering + NAT** | Firewall/NVA can inspect all cross-VNet traffic. |
| **Private Link (Service Exposure)** | Provider can place Firewall/NVA before the Private Link Service. |
| **VPN / ExpressRoute** | Network inspection at gateway level. |

✅ The customer **can inspect** all traffic **originating from or destined to HCL**, depending on where their firewall/NVA is placed.  

---

## 6️⃣ ASN (Autonomous System Number) — Background

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A unique identifier used in **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** for route advertisement. |
| **Azure Defaults** | Azure VWAN Hub uses ASN `65515`. |
| **Requirement** | Each BGP peer must have a **unique ASN** to prevent routing loops. |
| **Usage** | When connecting multiple networks (e.g., VWAN ↔ VPN Gateway), update one side’s ASN (e.g., 65010). |

---

## 7️⃣ Recommended Approach for Current Use Case

| Objective | Recommended Option |
|------------|--------------------|
| VNet-to-VNet with overlapping IPs | **VNet Peering + Azure Firewall/NVA (with NAT)** |
| VNet-to-VNet with unique IPs | **Direct VNet Peering** |
| Application-only connectivity | **Private Link / Private Endpoint** |
| Need for traffic inspection | **Firewall/NVA or Private Link with inspection layer** |

---

## 8️⃣ Summary of Key Takeaways

- **VNet Peering** offers the simplest private connectivity but lacks NAT.  
- **NAT must be implemented via Azure Firewall or NVA** for address hiding.  
- **Private Link** enables secure, service-level private access.  
- Both sides can **inspect and control traffic** depending on design.  
- The customer retains control of on-prem connectivity while HCL manages Azure-to-Azure integration.  
- Proper **NAT range planning**, **routing design**, and **security ownership** must be agreed upon before implementation.

---

## 9️⃣ Next Steps

1. Confirm final connectivity model (Peering + NAT or Private Link).  
2. Define NAT IP ranges and routing ownership.  
3. Finalize inspection points and logging requirements.  
4. Implement a pilot setup for validation and testing.
