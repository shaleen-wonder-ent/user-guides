- 99.99% uptime SLA

**Strategy:**
```yaml
Automatic Node Image Upgrades: ENABLED
Update Channel: "node-image"
Maintenance Windows: Tuesday 2-4 AM EST
Approval Process: Automated for patch versions

Configuration:
```

```bash
# Enable automatic node image upgrades
az aks update \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --name prod-aks-cluster \
  --auto-upgrade-channel node-image \
  --node-os-upgrade-channel NodeImage

# Configure maintenance window
az aks maintenanceconfiguration add \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --cluster-name prod-aks-cluster \
  --name default \
  --weekday Tuesday \
  --start-hour 2 \
  --duration 2

# Set up notifications
az monitor action-group create \
  --name aks-maintenance-alerts \
  --resource-group monitoring-rg \
  --short-name aksmaint \
  --email-receiver name=ops email=ops@company.com
```

**Results Achieved:**
- ✅ Reduced vulnerability window: 45 days → 7 days (84% improvement)
- ✅ Zero unplanned downtime in 18 months
- ✅ Passed SOC2 Type II and PCI-DSS audits
- ✅ Reduced manual effort: 40 hours/month → 2 hours/month

**Customer Quote:**
> "Automatic node image upgrades were game-changing. We went from monthly fire-drills to set-it-and-forget-it security. Our security team can now focus on strategic initiatives instead of emergency patching." - CISO, Fortune 100 Bank

---

#### Healthcare SaaS Provider Pattern

**Company Profile:**
- HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform
- 3 AKS clusters (dev, staging, prod)
- 500,000 patients
- Zero-downtime requirement

**Strategy:**
```yaml
Approach: Blue-Green Node Pool Deployments
Validation: 72-hour soak testing
Rollback: Tested monthly

Weekly Process:
  Monday: New node image released by Microsoft
  Tuesday: Auto-deploy to dev cluster
  Wednesday: Automated testing suite (1000+ tests)
  Thursday: Deploy to staging
  Friday-Sunday: Soak testing + monitoring
  Next Monday: Deploy to production (blue-green)
  Next Tuesday: Verify + delete old pool
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create new node pool with latest image
az aks nodepool add \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --cluster-name prod-aks-cluster \
  --name nodepool-v$(date +%Y%m%d) \
  --node-count 3 \
  --mode User \
  --labels deployment=blue-green version=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Step 2: Cordon old nodes (prevent new pods)
kubectl cordon -l agentpool=nodepool-old

# Step 3: Drain workloads gracefully
kubectl drain -l agentpool=nodepool-old \
  --ignore-daemonsets \
  --delete-emptydir-data \
  --grace-period=300 \
  --timeout=600s

# Step 4: Monitor for 24 hours
# If issues detected, reverse the process

# Step 5: Delete old pool
az aks nodepool delete \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --cluster-name prod-aks-cluster \
  --name nodepool-old \
  --no-wait
```

**Results Achieved:**
- ✅ Zero patient-facing downtime during upgrades
- ✅ Rollback capability within 5 minutes
- ✅ Full audit trail for HIPAA compliance
- ✅ Weekly patching (vs. quarterly before)

**Customer Quote:**
> "Blue-green node pools give us the confidence to patch weekly instead of quarterly. Patient safety is our #1 priority, and we can't afford downtime. This approach lets us stay secure without compromising availability." - CTO, Healthcare SaaS

### B. Worker Node Pools

#### Global E-Commerce Platform Pattern

**Company Profile:**
- Top 10 E-Commerce company
- 50M+ daily active users
- Black Friday: 10x normal traffic
- Revenue: $10B+ annually

**Strategy:**
```yaml
Node Pool Segregation: By workload criticality
Patch Cadences: Risk-based
Auto-Scaling: Enabled for all pools

Node Pool Architecture:
  1. critical-pool:
     Purpose: Payment, checkout, authentication
     Patch Window: Tuesday 3-5 AM (lowest traffic)
     SLA: 99.99% uptime
     Auto-Upgrade: Enabled with 48h staging validation
  
  2. standard-pool:
     Purpose: Product catalog, search, recommendations
     Patch Window: Daily maintenance window
     SLA: 99.9% uptime
     Auto-Upgrade: Enabled immediately
  
  3. batch-pool:
     Purpose: Analytics, reporting, ML training
     Patch Window: Anytime
     SLA: Best effort
     Auto-Upgrade: Enabled, no validation needed
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Critical workload pool (conservative patching)
az aks nodepool add \
  --name critical-pool \
  --cluster-name prod-aks \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --node-count 10 \
  --min-count 10 \
  --max-count 30 \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --node-taints workload=critical:NoSchedule \
  --labels criticality=high tier=critical \
  --priority Regular \
  --eviction-policy Delete

# Standard workload pool (balanced approach)
az aks nodepool add \
  --name standard-pool \
  --cluster-name prod-aks \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --node-count 5 \
  --min-count 5 \
  --max-count 50 \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --labels criticality=medium tier=standard \
  --priority Regular

# Batch workload pool (aggressive patching, cost-optimized)
az aks nodepool add \
  --name batch-pool \
  --cluster-name prod-aks \
  --resource-group prod-rg \
  --node-count 3 \
  --min-count 0 \
  --max-count 20 \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler \
  --labels criticality=low tier=batch \
  --node-taints workload=batch:NoSchedule \
  --priority Spot \
  --eviction-policy Delete \
  --spot-max-price -1
```

**Pod Scheduling Examples:**
```yaml
# Critical payment pod (scheduled to critical-pool only)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    criticality: high
  tolerations:
  - key: "workload"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "critical"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: payment
    image: payment:v1.0
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "2Gi"
        cpu: "1000m"
      limits:
        memory: "4Gi"
        cpu: "2000m"

# Batch analytics pod (scheduled to batch-pool, can tolerate eviction)
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: analytics-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        criticality: low
      tolerations:
      - key: "workload"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "batch"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      - key: "kubernetes.azure.com/scalesetpriority"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "spot"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - name: analytics
        image: analytics:v2.0
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "4Gi"
            cpu: "2000m"
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

**Results Achieved:**
- ✅ Reduced blast radius (critical workloads isolated)
- ✅ Faster patching for non-critical workloads (daily vs. monthly)
- ✅ Cost optimization: Batch pool uses Spot VMs (60% cost reduction)
- ✅ Black Friday 2024: Zero incidents, handled 15x traffic spike
- ✅ Annual savings: $2M in infrastructure costs

**Customer Quote:**
> "Separating node pools by criticality was a game-changer. We can be aggressive with patching where it doesn't matter, and ultra-conservative for payment processing. During Black Friday, our batch workloads auto-scaled on cheap Spot VMs while critical services stayed rock-solid on dedicated nodes." - VP Engineering, E-Commerce Platform

**Results Achieved:**
- ✅ Mean time to patch vulnerabilities: 45 days → 3 days (93% improvement)
- ✅ Developer productivity: Zero manual security tasks
- ✅ Compliance: 100% audit pass rate (SOC2, ISO 27001)
- ✅ Cost: $0 additional infrastructure (uses existing CI/CD)
- ✅ False positive rate: <1% (high-quality scans)
- ✅ Security incidents: 0 in 24 months

**Common Mistakes (What NOT to Do):**
```yaml
❌ NEVER DO THIS:
  1. Running apt-get update in production containers
     Why: Violates immutability, creates drift, hard to audit
  
  2. Patching running containers
     Why: Violates immutability, doesn't persist across restarts
  
  3. Using :latest tags
     Why: Breaks reproducibility, can't rollback reliably
  
  4. Manual image builds
     Why: Doesn't scale, human error, inconsistent
  
  5. Skipping scans for "small changes"
     Why: Small changes can introduce critical vulnerabilities
  
  6. Building from Dockerfiles in production
     Why: Untested, can pull malicious dependencies
  
  7. Storing secrets in container images
     Why: Secrets leak in registries, hard to rotate

✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:
  1. Rebuild and redeploy containers
  2. Immutable infrastructure (treat as cattle, not pets)
  3. Use specific SHA256 digests
  4. Automated CI/CD for all builds
  5. Scan every build, no exceptions
  6. Deploy pre-built, scanned images from registry
  7. Use Azure Key Vault + Workload Identity
```

**Customer Quote:**
> "We treat containers like cattle, not pets. When a vulnerability is found, we rebuild and redeploy. Never patch in place. This mindset shift reduced our vulnerability exposure by 90% and made our deployments 10x faster and more reliable." - Chief Architect, SaaS Platform

Now we're more secure than competitors spending 100x more. The auditor was impressed that a startup our size had such mature security. Best investment we ever made."
> 
> — CTO, Healthcare Startup

**Lessons Learned:**
```yaml
What Worked:
  ✅ Started with minimum viable security stack
  ✅ Automated everything from day one
  ✅ Used native Azure services (less to manage)
  ✅ Defense in depth vs. expensive single tool
  ✅ Documented everything for audit

What Didn't Work:
  ❌ Initially tried to use 5 different tools (too complex)
  ❌ Manual processes (didn't scale)
  ❌ Over-engineering (YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It)

Recommendations for Other Startups:
  1. Start lean, add tools as you grow
  2. Automate or die (2-person team can't do manual security)
  3. Use cloud-native services (managed = less to secure)
  4. Document for compliance from day one
  5. Defense in depth > expensive SIEM
```

Security Stack (All Regions):
- Prisma Cloud (primary scanner + runtime protection)
- Microsoft Defender (threat intelligence + Azure integration)
- Aqua Security (image assurance + admission control)
- Azure Firewall Premium (network security)
- Azure DDoS Protection (network layer)
- CrowdStrike Falcon (host protection)
```

**Key Takeaways for Other Enterprises:**
```yaml
Lessons Learned:
  1. Blue-Green Architecture = Zero Downtime
     - Worth 2x infrastructure cost
     - Enables weekly patching without stress
  
  2. Defense in Depth > Single Tool
     - Prisma caught what Defender missed (3 times)
     - Defender caught what Prisma missed (5 times)
     - Redundancy = resilience
  
  3. Automation is Non-Negotiable
     - Manual processes don't scale to 200 clusters
     - Automation = consistency = compliance
  
  4. Follow-the-Sun Security Works
     - 24/7 coverage without burnout
     - Faster response times
     - Better work-life balance
  
  5. Invest in People AND Tools
     - 12-person team managing 200 clusters
     - Training budget: $10K/person/year
     - Happy team = secure systems

What Would We Do Differently:
  ❌ Started with too many tools (eliminated 40%)
  ❌ Over-engineered some solutions (KISS principle)
  ✅ But overall: Very happy with outcomes
